### 2. MCP Server Setup (Optional)
For advanced features, set up the MCP server integration:

1. Copy the MCP configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/claude_desktop_config.json ~/.config/claude-desktop/config.json
   ```

2. Ensure Earth Agents CLI is installed and built:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm link  # Makes 'earth' and 'earth-mcp' commands available globally
   ```

3. Test the MCP server:
   ```bash
   earth mcp  # Should show MCP server configuration
   ```

4. Restart Claude Desktop to load the new configuration
