# Earth Agents UI Development Workflow Demo

## Scenario: Building a Dashboard Component

### Step 1: Design to Code with Sketchie
```bash
/earth:sketch "Create a dashboard with:
- Header with user profile and notifications
- Sidebar with navigation menu
- Main content area with stats cards
- Chart visualization section
- Recent activity feed"
```

**Sketchie Output:**
- 5 TypeScript React components generated
- Fully typed props interfaces
- Styled-components with theme
- Responsive grid layout
- WCAG AA accessibility

### Step 2: Quality Analysis with Botbie
```bash
/earth:analyze ./src/components/Dashboard
```

**Botbie Analysis:**
```
🤖 Code Quality Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Quality Score: 92/100

✅ Strengths:
- Clean component structure
- Proper TypeScript usage
- Good separation of concerns

⚠️ Issues Found:
- Missing error boundaries (High)
- Large bundle size in ChartSection (Medium)
- Complex nesting in ActivityFeed (Low)
```

### Step 3: Accessibility Audit
```bash
/earth:ui ./src/components/Dashboard --focus accessibility
```

**Sketchie Accessibility Report:**
```
♿ Accessibility Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WCAG Level: AA (87% compliant)

✅ Passes:
- Keyboard navigation complete
- ARIA labels present
- Focus management correct

❌ Issues:
- Low contrast in stats cards (4.2:1, needs 4.5:1)
- Missing alt text for user avatars
- No skip navigation link
```

### Step 4: Auto-Fix Issues
```bash
/earth:fix accessibility
```

**Fix Engine Output:**
```
🔧 Auto-Fix Applied
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Fixed color contrast (now 4.6:1)
✅ Added alt text to 8 images
✅ Added skip navigation link
✅ Implemented error boundaries
✅ Code split ChartSection (-45KB)

All fixes applied successfully!
```

### Step 5: Performance Optimization
```bash
/earth:workflow ui-development
```

**Workflow Execution:**
```
🔗 UI Development Workflow

```

### Step 6: Design System Integration
```bash
/earth:design extract ./src/components
```

**Design System Extracted:**
```
🎨 Design Tokens Extracted

```bash
/earth:insights
```

**Learning Engine Insights:**
```
💡 Cross-Agent Insights
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔴 Pattern: "Dashboard Performance"
   Confidence: 94%
   Learning: Chart components cause 73% of performance issues
   Action: Implemented lazy loading by default

🟡 Pattern: "Accessibility Gaps"
   Confidence: 88%
   Learning: Team often misses contrast in data visualizations
   Action: Added automatic contrast checking

🟢 Pattern: "Component Reuse"
   Confidence: 91%
   Learning: Stats cards used across 5 projects
   Action: Created reusable component library

Team Adaptation:
- Prefers functional components (100%)
- Uses styled-components (87%)
- Implements error boundaries (now 95%)
```
