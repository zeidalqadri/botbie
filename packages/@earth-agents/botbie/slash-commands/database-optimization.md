### 🔍 Detailed Query Analysis
```sql
-- BEFORE: Inefficient N+1 Query Pattern
users.forEach(user => {
  const posts = await Post.findAll({ where: { userId: user.id } });
  // 1 + N queries executed
});

-- AFTER: Optimized with Include/Join
const usersWithPosts = await User.findAll({
  include: [{ model: Post }]
});
// Single optimized query
```

🗄️  DATABASE OPTIMIZATION REPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Performance Score: 42/100 (NEEDS OPTIMIZATION)

🐌 SLOW QUERIES DETECTED (5 found):
├─ Product search: 2.3s avg (should be <100ms)
├─ User orders fetch: 1.8s avg (N+1 query problem)
├─ Inventory updates: 4.1s avg (missing indexes)
├─ Sales reports: 8.2s avg (full table scan)
├─ Related products: 3.5s avg (inefficient joins)

🎯 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:

📈 IMMEDIATE WINS (Est. 60% improvement):
1. Add composite index on products(category_id, price, created_at)
   Impact: Reduces product search from 2.3s to 0.08s
   
2. Fix N+1 query in order history
   Impact: 15 queries → 1 query, 1.8s → 0.12s
   
3. Optimize inventory batch updates
   Impact: Use UPSERT instead of individual updates

🏗️  SCHEMA IMPROVEMENTS:
├─ Products table needs partitioning by category
├─ Orders table missing index on (user_id, status, created_at)
├─ Consider denormalizing order_total for faster reporting
├─ Archive old orders (>2 years) to separate table

⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
🔄 Connection Pool: Increase to 20 connections
💾 Query Cache: Enable for product catalog queries  
🏃 Async Processing: Move heavy analytics to background jobs
📊 Read Replica: Route reports to read-only replica

💡 SPECIALIST RECOMMENDATIONS:

Data Engineer Insights:
• Implement CDC (Change Data Capture) for real-time analytics
• Create materialized views for dashboard queries
• Use time-series partitioning for order history
• Implement proper data retention policies

Performance Engineer Insights:  
• Add monitoring for query execution times
• Implement circuit breakers for database calls
• Use connection pooling with proper timeout settings
• Consider caching layer for frequently accessed data

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
Week 1: Add critical indexes and fix N+1 queries
Week 2: Implement connection pooling and caching
Week 3: Schema optimizations and partitioning
Week 4: Read replica setup and monitoring
```
