# Security Audit with Specialist Analysis

I'm Botbie with enhanced security analysis capabilities! 🔒🤖

I'll conduct a comprehensive security audit using my **Security Auditor** specialist, who is an expert in OWASP compliance, vulnerability detection, and security best practices.

## What I'll Analyze

### 🛡️ OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
- **Injection Attacks** - SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS command injection
- **Broken Authentication** - Session management, credential security
- **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Encryption, data protection
- **XML External Entities (XXE)** - XML parser vulnerabilities
- **Broken Access Control** - Authorization bypasses
- **Security Misconfigurations** - Default configurations, unnecessary features
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Reflected, stored, DOM-based XSS
- **Insecure Deserialization** - Object injection attacks
- **Known Vulnerabilities** - Outdated dependencies, frameworks
- **Insufficient Logging** - Security event monitoring

### 🔍 Code Security Patterns
- **Input Validation** - User input sanitization and validation
- **Authentication Systems** - JWT, OAuth, session security
- **Authorization Logic** - Role-based access control
- **Cryptographic Practices** - Hashing, encryption, key management
- **API Security** - Rate limiting, CORS, API key management
- **Database Security** - Query parameterization, connection security
- **Error Handling** - Information disclosure prevention
- **Security Headers** - CSRF, CSP, HSTS implementation

## How to Use

**Quick Security Scan:**
"Run a security audit on this project"

**Focused Analysis:**
- "Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities"
- "Audit authentication system security"
- "Review API security configuration"
- "Scan for hardcoded secrets"

**File-Specific Audit:**
"Security audit this authentication file: [file path]"

## What You'll Get

### 📊 Security Assessment Report
- **Security Score** (0-100) with risk classification
- **Vulnerability Summary** categorized by OWASP Top 10
- **Critical Issues** requiring immediate attention
- **Risk Assessment** with potential impact analysis

### 🔍 Detailed Findings
- **Vulnerability Location** - Exact file paths and line numbers
- **Severity Rating** - Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **OWASP Category** - Which Top 10 category each issue falls under
- **Attack Vectors** - How vulnerabilities could be exploited
- **Business Impact** - Potential consequences of each vulnerability

### 💡 Remediation Guidance
- **Immediate Actions** - Critical fixes to implement right away
- **Code Examples** - Secure coding patterns and fixes
- **Best Practices** - Security guidelines for your tech stack
- **Compliance Mapping** - OWASP, PCI DSS, SOC2 alignment
- **Testing Recommendations** - Security testing strategies

### 🎯 Prioritized Action Plan
1. **Critical Security Issues** - Fix immediately
2. **High-Risk Vulnerabilities** - Address within days
3. **Security Improvements** - Implement over time
4. **Preventive Measures** - Long-term security strategy

## Example Security Audit

**You:** "Run a comprehensive security audit on my authentication system"

🔒 SECURITY AUDIT REPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Security Score: 68/100 (MEDIUM RISK)

🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (2 found):
├─ Hardcoded JWT secret in auth.js:23
├─ SQL injection vulnerability in user-queries.js:45

⚠️  HIGH RISK (4 found):
├─ Missing input validation on login endpoint
├─ Weak password policy enforcement
├─ Session tokens not properly invalidated
├─ Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints

💡 SPECIALIST RECOMMENDATIONS:
🔐 Move JWT secrets to environment variables
🛡️  Implement parameterized queries for all database operations
⚡ Add bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12 for password hashing
🚫 Implement exponential backoff for failed login attempts
📝 Add comprehensive audit logging for security events

📋 COMPLIANCE GAPS:
├─ OWASP A2: Broken Authentication
├─ OWASP A3: Sensitive Data Exposure
├─ OWASP A6: Security Misconfiguration

🎯 NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix critical JWT secret exposure (30 minutes)
2. Remediate SQL injection vulnerability (1 hour)
3. Implement proper input validation (2 hours)
4. Add rate limiting and security headers (1 hour)
```
