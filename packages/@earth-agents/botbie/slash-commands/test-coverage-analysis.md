```

### 🎯 Missing Test Scenarios

#### ❌ Critical Gaps Identified
```javascript
// UNTESTED: Error handling in payment processing
async function processPayment(amount, cardToken) {
  try {
    const result = await stripe.charges.create({
      amount,
      currency: 'usd',
      source: cardToken
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    // ❌ This error path is NEVER tested!
    logger.error('Payment failed:', error);
    throw new PaymentError('Payment processing failed');
  }
}

// MISSING TESTS:
// ✅ Need: Payment success scenario
// ❌ Missing: Card declined scenario  
// ❌ Missing: Network timeout scenario
// ❌ Missing: Invalid token scenario
// ❌ Missing: Insufficient funds scenario
```

### 💡 Test Enhancement Recommendations

#### 🧪 Test Quality Improvements
- **Assertion Strengthening** - More specific and meaningful assertions
- **Test Data Factories** - Consistent and realistic test data
- **Setup/Teardown** - Proper test isolation and cleanup
- **Mock Strategy** - Effective external dependency mocking
- **Test Organization** - Logical test grouping and naming

#### 📋 Missing Test Categories
- **Boundary Testing** - Min/max values, empty inputs
- **State Transition Testing** - Workflow and status changes
- **Concurrency Testing** - Race conditions and thread safety
- **Security Testing** - Input validation and authorization
- **Performance Testing** - Response time and throughput

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Coverage Summary:

Line Coverage: 72% (Target: 85%+)
Branch Coverage: 58% (Target: 80%+)
Function Coverage: 84% (Good)

🎯 CRITICAL TESTING GAPS (7 found):

1. 🚨 UNTESTED ERROR PATHS:
   File: UserService.ts
   Method: createUser()
   Missing: Email validation failure handling
   Risk: High - Could allow invalid users
   
2. 🔒 SECURITY TESTS Missing:
   Component: Authentication middleware
   Gap: No tests for JWT token expiration
   Risk: Critical - Security vulnerability
   
3. 📊 INTEGRATION TESTS Insufficient:
   Service: UserRepository
   Coverage: 34% (Target: 60%+)
   Gap: Database constraint violations untested

💡 SPECIALIST TEST RECOMMENDATIONS:

🧪 Test Quality Assessment:
Current Issues:
• 23% of tests have weak assertions (expect(result).toBeTruthy())
• 15% of tests are not properly isolated (shared state)
• Mock overuse - 67% of unit tests mock everything
• Test names are unclear (test1, test2, testUserCreation)

Improvements Needed:
✅ Replace weak assertions with specific expectations
✅ Implement test data factories for consistency
✅ Reduce mocking for better integration confidence
✅ Use descriptive test names following Given-When-Then

describe('UserService - Password Security', () => {
  it('should reject passwords shorter than 8 characters', async () => {
    // Given
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: '1234567' // 7 characters
    };
    
    // When & Then
    await expect(userService.createUser(userData))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('Password must be at least 8 characters');
  });
  
  it('should require password complexity', async () => {
    // Given
    const userData = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'simple123' // No special characters
    };
    
    // When & Then
    await expect(userService.createUser(userData))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('Password must contain special characters');
  });
});
