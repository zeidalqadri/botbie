## Usage Examples

**Production Bug Investigation:**
"Our users are experiencing intermittent 500 errors on the checkout page - investigate and fix"

**Performance Debugging:**
"The application response time has increased from 200ms to 2s over the past week"

**Memory Leak Analysis:**
"Our Node.js application memory usage keeps growing and eventually crashes"

**Database Performance Issues:**
"Queries are running very slowly, especially during peak hours"

**Network Connectivity Problems:**
"API calls to external services are timing out randomly"
