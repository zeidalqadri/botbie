🗄️  DATABASE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:

Query Performance Issues:
├─ Slowest Query: getUserStats() - 2.3s avg
│  └─ Missing index on user_activities(user_id, created_at)
├─ Most Frequent: getProductList() - 800ms avg  
│  └─ Full table scan on products table
└─ Most Resource Intensive: generateReport() - 4.1s avg
   └─ Complex joins without proper indexing

Database Optimization Plan:
1. Index Creation (Immediate - 30 minutes):
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_activities_user_date 
   ON user_activities(user_id, created_at);
   
   CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_price 
   ON products(category_id, price, status);

2. Query Rewriting (Short-term - 2 days):
   -- Replace N+1 pattern with single query
   SELECT u.*, COUNT(a.id) as activity_count
   FROM users u 
   LEFT JOIN activities a ON u.id = a.user_id 
   GROUP BY u.id;

3. Schema Optimization (Medium-term - 1 week):
   • Denormalize frequently accessed data
   • Add materialized views for complex aggregations
   • Implement table partitioning for large tables

Expected Database Performance Gains:
