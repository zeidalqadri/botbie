### 💡 Specialist Analysis

#### 🔧 DevOps Troubleshooter Insights
```
🛠️  INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS:

System Resource Status:
├─ CPU Usage: 85% (High but not critical)
├─ Memory: 78% (Within normal range)  
├─ Disk I/O: 45% (Normal)
└─ Network: 23% (Low)

Database Health:
├─ Connection Pool: 100% utilized (CRITICAL)
├─ Active Connections: 50/50 (Max reached)
├─ Queue Length: 127 pending (High)
├─ Query Performance: +340% slower
└─ Lock Waits: 89 blocked queries

Recent Changes Detected:
• Deploy #1247 at 13:15 (1 hour before incident)
• Database migration #0089 at 12:30
• Traffic increase: +67% from marketing campaign

Correlation Analysis:
The connection pool size wasn't updated after the 
recent migration that added new background jobs.
Background processing is consuming 35 of 50 connections.

#### 📈 Site Reliability Engineer Assessment
```
📊 SLO/SLA IMPACT ANALYSIS:

Service Level Indicators:
├─ Availability: 98.7% (Target: 99.9%) ❌
├─ Error Rate: 12.3% (Target: <0.1%) ❌  
├─ Response Time: 8.2s avg (Target: <2s) ❌
└─ Throughput: -45% (Severely degraded) ❌

Error Budget Status:
Monthly Budget: 99.9% uptime = 43.8 minutes downtime
Consumed Today: 22 minutes (50% of monthly budget!)
Remaining Budget: 21.8 minutes for rest of month

Reliability Recommendations:
🎯 Immediate: Increase DB connection pool to 100
⚡ Short-term: Implement connection pool monitoring
🏗️  Long-term: Separate pools for API vs background jobs
📊 Monitoring: Add connection pool utilization alerts

Post-Incident Actions Required:
1. Update runbooks with connection pool guidance
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern
3. Add connection pool metrics to dashboard
4. Schedule connection pool capacity review
```

### 🎯 Remediation Roadmap

#### 🚨 Immediate Actions (0-2 hours)
1. **Scale Database Connections** - Increase pool size from 50 to 100
2. **Restart Payment Service** - Clear any hung connections
3. **Monitor Recovery** - Watch error rates and response times
4. **Customer Communication** - Notify affected users of resolution

#### ⚡ Short-term Fixes (2-24 hours)
1. **Separate Connection Pools** - Isolate API from background jobs
2. **Add Monitoring** - Connection pool utilization alerts
