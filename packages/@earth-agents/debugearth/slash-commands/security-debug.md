### 💡 Specialist Security Analysis

#### 🔒 Security Auditor Investigation
```
🔍 SECURITY FORENSICS ANALYSIS:

Attack Vector Analysis:
1. 🎯 Credential Stuffing Attack
   Source: Botnet (47 unique IP addresses)
   Method: Automated password spraying
   Target: Admin login endpoints
   Success Rate: 0.2% (1 successful login out of 500 attempts)

2. ⬆️ Privilege Escalation  
   Method: Exploited admin role assignment bug
   Technique: JWT token manipulation
   Impact: Gained super-admin privileges
   Detection: Role change audit log triggered alert

3. 📊 Data Exfiltration Attempt
   Target: User database export function
   Volume: 10,000 user records accessed
   Prevention: WAF blocked bulk database queries
   Evidence: Export logs show suspicious patterns

Security Control Assessment:
├─ ✅ Multi-factor Authentication: Not bypassed
├─ ❌ Rate Limiting: Insufficient (allowed 500 attempts)
├─ ✅ WAF Protection: Blocked malicious queries  
├─ ❌ Privileged Access Monitoring: 5-minute delay
├─ ✅ Audit logging: Captured all activities
└─ ⚠️  Account Lockout: Triggered after compromise

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
• IP Addresses: 192.168.1.100, 10.0.0.5 (suspicious)
• User Agents: Automated tools detected
• Login Patterns: Rapid sequential attempts
• JWT Tokens: Modified admin role claims
• File Access: Bulk user data downloads
```

#### 🌐 Network Architect Security Assessment  
```
🌐 NETWORK SECURITY ANALYSIS:

Network Traffic Analysis:
┌─ Suspicious Activity Detected ──────────────────────┐
│ • Traffic Volume: 3x normal during attack window   │
│ • Geographic Anomaly: 67% traffic from Eastern EU  │
│ • Protocol Analysis: HTTP flood patterns detected  │
│ • Bandwidth Usage: +400% on admin endpoints        │
│ • SSL/TLS: Valid certificates, no MitM detected    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Infrastructure Security Posture:
├─ Firewall Rules: Effective (blocked 89% of attempts)
├─ DDoS Protection: Partially effective (some bypassed)
├─ CDN Security: WAF rules prevented data exfiltration
├─ Load Balancer: Distributed attack load appropriately  
├─ VPN Access: Not compromised (admin used web login)
└─ Internal Network: No lateral movement detected

Network-Based Countermeasures Applied:
1. IP Blacklisting: 47 attacker IPs blocked
2. Geoblocking: Eastern European traffic filtered
3. Rate Limiting: Enhanced to 5 attempts/minute
4. WAF Rules: Added admin panel protection
5. DDoS Mitigation: Enabled advanced protection

Recommended Network Hardening:
🛡️  Implement zero-trust network architecture
🔐 Add certificate pinning for admin interfaces
📊 Deploy network behavior analysis (NBA)
🚫 Implement geo-fencing for admin access
⚡ Add real-time threat intelligence feeds
